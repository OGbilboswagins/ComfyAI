# ComfyAI Roadmap

This roadmap is **balanced** between ambition and realism.  
It reflects where ComfyAI is headed over the next series of releases.

## ✅ v0.3.x — Chat Foundation (Current)

- Embedded chat panel inside ComfyUI
- Provider + model selection
- Streaming responses + typing indicator
- Settings panel with tabs and icons
- Persistent settings file
- Comfy Registry integration

## 🚧 v0.4.x — Web Search & Context

- Optional web search integration for certain providers
- Settings for enabling/disabling network access
- Basic "search + answer" flows inside chat

## 🚧 v0.5.x — Plan & Edit Modes

- Three primary modes:
  - **Chat** — normal assistant chat
  - **Plan** — multi-step reasoning about workflows or tasks
  - **Edit** — propose modifications to workflows
- UI for selecting mode and default models per mode
- Internal representation for workflow edit requests

## 🚧 v0.6.x — Workflow Automation (Phase 1)

- Read current ComfyUI workflow graph
- Let the AI suggest node-level changes in a structured format
- Experimental "apply changes" button (opt-in & safe)
- Logging and diff view for automation steps

## 🚧 v0.7.x — Tools, MCP & Integrations

- Tool-style interfaces for:
  - Listing workflows
  - Loading/saving workflows
  - Triggering queue jobs
- Optional MCP or similar interface for external tool integration
- Advanced settings for power users

## 📌 Long-Term Ideas

- Per-project profiles (models, prompts, settings)
- Shared presets and "recipes" for ComfyAI behavior
- Export/import of ComfyAI configuration
- Multi-user / multi-session awareness in multi-user ComfyUI setups
