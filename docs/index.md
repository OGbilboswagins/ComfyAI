# ComfyAI Documentation

Welcome to **ComfyAI**, your AI copilot inside ComfyUI.

This `docs/` folder can be used later with GitHub Pages or a static site generator,
but for now it provides a central place to expand documentation as the project grows.

## Contents

- `README.md` (project overview)
- `ROADMAP.md` (feature roadmap)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (notable changes)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (how to help)
- `SECURITY.md` (security policy)
- `SUPPORT.md` (support instructions)

As ComfyAI evolves, you can add:

- Detailed usage guides
- Provider-specific setup docs
- Examples and screenshots
- FAQ and troubleshooting
