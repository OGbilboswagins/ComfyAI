## 🛈 What Is ComfyAI?

It lets you:

- 🗨️ Chat with LLMs directly inside ComfyUI
- ⚡ Plan and debug workflows in natural language
- 🎛 Switch between local and cloud models via providers
- ⚙️ Configure everything through a fullscreen settings panel
- 🛠 (Roadmap) Use AI-powered modes like **Chat / Plan / Edit** to control how the assistant behaves

All without leaving the ComfyUI interface.
